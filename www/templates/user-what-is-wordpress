A lot of the groups we provide hosting for are using WordPress [1] to
power their site. It lets you easily add/change/remove pages without
touching any code directly. You can do it all from your web browser.

If you're just looking to choose an existing website design and use
it, WordPress is probably the best way to go. There are thousands of
themes that you can use.

Keep in mind if you're setting up your site that you want to set it up
on OCF hosting [2]. So you *don't* want to register an account at
wordpress.com or set up the site there.

We'd be happy to help you during staff hours [3] if you need help setting it
up.
