To reactivate the account, we would need you to first confirm your
identity. Unfortunately, there's no email on the account, and it's not
linked against any CalNet ID since it's such an old account, so we
would need you to follow the manual verification steps.

The process for reactivating the account is outlined on our website:
https://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/docs/services/account/#manual-reset

If you wish to email in a copy of your ID in order to reset the
account password (as outlined at the link above), please send it to me
directly ({staffer}@ocf.berkeley.edu) and do *not* reply to this email.
We don't want them to be stored in the ticket system for privacy
reasons.

Sorry for the annoying process. It's difficult for us to verify the
identity of alumni since the university won't allow us access to alumni
LDAP entries.

Let me know if you have any questions!
