We can't provide @berkeley.edu emails (those are controlled by campus).

If you're interested, we could provide virtual hosting instead. This
is a service we provide to many student groups that gives a website
(something like <yourgroup>.berkeley.edu) and as many email forwarding
addresses @<yourgroup>.berkeley.edu as you'd like (you can create them
for club members, officers, etc.). This is open to all RSOs. We can also
provide just mail hosting (without a website) if you prefer.

If you're only interested in an @berkeley.edu email, you'll want to
contact someone with the university instead.
