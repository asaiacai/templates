We can't provide @berkeley.edu emails (those are controlled by campus).

If you're interested, we could provide virtual hosting instead. This
is a service we provide to many student groups that gives a website
(something like <yourgroup>.berkeley.edu) and as many emails
@<yourgroup>.berkeley.edu as you'd like (you can create them for club
members, officers, etc.). This is open to all RSOs. We can also
provide just virtual hosting (without a website) if that's what you
desire.

If you're only interested in an @berkeley.edu email, you'll want to
contact someone with the university instead.
