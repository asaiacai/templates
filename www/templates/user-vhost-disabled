Your virtual host was disabled on {date} because it didn't have the
required Hosted by OCF banner. We tried to contact your group prior to disabling
your site, but we did not have a current contact email on file for your group.

I've reenabled your virtual host. Please make sure your website has a Hosted by
OCF banner and the required student group disclaimer[1] in order to avoid
having it disabled again. You should also update your email address by logging
in via SSH[2] and running the "update-email" command.
