I've re-enabled your account. It was disabled on {date} due to an
outdated WordPress installation which was posing a security risk. We
didn't have any contact information on file for you, so weren't able
to contact you beforehand.

You should log in to your account via SSH[1] and run the
"update-email" command to set your email so that we can contact you in
the future.

Please also make sure to either remove or update the WordPress installation.
